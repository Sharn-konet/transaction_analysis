# Data Analysis Aptitude Test

This repository is an investigation into a dataset openly available on Kaggle containing transaction data for a small shop in the UK. 
The full notebook has been exported as a pdf which can be easily read directly from Github.

The investigation involves a significant amount of exploratory analysis, and handling of bad data. Due to time constraints, some sections may be brief or underdeveloped, particularly in terms of prediction.
